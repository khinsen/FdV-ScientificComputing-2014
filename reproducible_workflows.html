# Reproducibility in science

 - One of the ideals of science: any competent scientist who follows
   the same steps as you do should make the same observations.

 - Reality is a bit different: there are uncontrolled conditions in
   experiments that cannot be documented and reproduced.

 - In computational work, reproducibility should be perfect, because
   the computer is deterministic. Just record everything.

 - In practice, computational science is _less_ reproducible than
   most experiments.

 - The problem: recording _everything_ is very difficult:

   - all the input data: local files, database downloads, ...
   - all the software, including OS, compilers, ...
   - **_all input you provide to your computer interactively_**

---

# Adopt a best-effort approach

Making your work 100% reproducible for eternity is not a realistic
goals right now. But you can probablt do better than what you are
doing now.

### Reproducing your own work on your own computer

Goals:

 - know exactly how every figure in your thesis/paper was produced:
   from which data, using which computational steps
 - if any dataset or program changes, update everything that depends
   on it automatically

This is the topic of today's session.

### Keep track of what you do

 - Use version control for all your research.
 - Write down the versions of all software that you use.
 - Prefer open-source software to proprietary packages.
 - Get the papers that describe the computational methods you use.

# Workflow management

### Scripting

A simple approach for workflows that do not take much time: write a script
in your favorite language that does _all_ the computations.

### Command-line workflow managers

 - [Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/):
   The oldest and most widely used one,
   originally designed for software build processes.
   A bit messy, just like git.

 - [Drake](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/):
   A recent development specifically for data workflows.
   Not quite ready for serious use in my opinion.

### Graphical workflow managers

 - [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/)

 - [Kepler](http://kepler-project.org/)

 - [Taverna](http://www.taverna.org.uk/)

 - [VisTrails](http://www.vistrails.org/index.php/Main_Page)

# The Unix command line toolkit

 - Lots of programs with cryptic names and cryptic parameters,
   optimized for rapid typing.

 - Each tool does one task and does it well.

 - Designed to work together.

 - Most tools work with text files or text streams.

 - The output of one tool can be used as the input of another one
   without creating an intermediate file.

 - It’s easy to write a special-purpose tool that integrates with the
   standard tools.

Unix is a family of operating systems that was created in the
1970s. It includes Linux and MacOS X.

The Git for Windows installation contains most of these tools as well

---

# Getting started

 - `man <command>` shows you the manual for a command

 - `apropos <keyword>` lists commands whose manual contains the keyword

 - Start by looking at `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `rm`, `file`, `od`, `cat`

Rather than list commands here, I will switch to live demonstrations!

---

# Pipelines

Chain of commands in which the output of each command is fed into the
next one as input.

Examples:

 - `ls -l | more`

 - `grep '^ATOM.*[[:space:]]CA[[:space:]]' 3KYH.pdb | wc -l`

 - `cat <file> | tr ' ' '\r' | sort | uniq`

---

# I/O redirection

Output redirection: write to a file instead of the terminal (more
precisely: “standard output”)

Example:

    ls -1R > all_my_files

Input redirection: read from a file instead of the terminal (more
precisely: “standard input”)

Example:

    tr ' ' '\r' < <file> | sort | uniq

# Regular expressions

 - search patterns for text

 - used by `grep`, `awk`, and by many text editors

 - very powerful, rather cryptic: takes time to master

 - check out [this tutorial](http://www.regular-expressions.info/)

Examples:

 - `books?` matches `book` and `books`

 - `gr[ae]y` matches `gray` and `grey`

 - `\b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b` matches any valid e-mail address

The last example shows how complex regular expressions can beome.

# Getting started with `make`

There are many `make` tutorials written for software developers.
Google `make tutorial` will give you a large choice.
[This one](http://www.linuxforu.com/2012/06/gnu-make-in-detail-for-beginners/)
is a reasonable start for our purposes.

The [GNU make
manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/index.html)
tells you everything you ever wanted to know about `make`, plus a lot
more.

## Concepts and jargon

**Makefile**: a file defining a workflow. Contains a sequence of _rules_.

**Rule**: Defines how to make a _target_ given its _prerequisites_
          by applying _recipes_.

**Target**: the result of a step in the workflow. This can be the name of
            a file that will be produced, or some arbitrary label.

**Prerequisite**: targets that need to be made before the current rule
                  can be applied.

**Recipe**: a shell command that can contain _special variables_.

---

# Rules

A rule has the form:

    target ... : prerequisites ...
            recipe
            ...
            ...

**Every recipe line must start with a tab character!**

_Example:_

    overview.html:
            wget http://rawgithub.com/khinsen/FdV-ScientificComputing-2014/master/overview.html

This rule creates the file `overview.html` by downloading it from the
GitHub repository for this cours.

_Example:_

    slide_count: overview.html
            grep -c ^\\-\\-\\- overview.html | dc -e '? 1 + p' > slide_count

This rule counts the number of slides in `overview.html`.

---

# Special variables

On the last slide, the recipes repeated the filenames given as targets or
prerequisites. This can easily lead to mistakes (chaging the name in one place
but not in the other), and it prevents generic rules (next slide).

This is why `make` proposes its _special variables_, which stand for
filenames or parts of them:

 - `$@` full name of the current target
 - `$<` name of the first dependency
 - `$^` names of all dependencies, separated by spaces
 - `$?` the dependencies that are newer than the target

Our examples can be rewritten as

    overview.html:
            wget http://rawgithub.com/khinsen/FdV-ScientificComputing-2014/master/$@

    slide_count: overview.html
            grep -c ^\\-\\-\\- $< | dc -e '? 1 + p' > $@

---

# Patterns

It is possible to define rules for categories of targets using
_patterns_. A pattern contains a single `%` symbol that stands
for any text string.

_Example_:

    %.slide_count: %.html
            grep -c ^\\-\\-\\- $< | dc -e '? 1 + p' > $@

This rule says that any target whose name ends in 
`.slide_count` can be made from a file with the same name
but extension `.html` using the given recipe.

Obviously, patterns _require_ special variables. There is one more
of those:

 - `$*` the text that corresponds to `%` in the target

# Today's exercice problem

**Goal**: for a given PDB code, check if the crystal structure
lacks any residues.

**Approach**:

 - download the PDB structure file
 - download the corresponding FASTA file containing the sequence
 - count how often each residue type occurs in the structure
 - count how often each residue type occurs in the sequence
 - compare the counts to see if anything is missing in the structure

Write a `Makefile` that provides these five steps, and lets you
run any of them individually.

Use whatever tools you know/like in the recipes, including whatever
your favorite programming language is.

Test your methods using one structure that is complete (e.g. 193L)
and one structure that isn't (e.g. 3KYH).

**Bonus version**: if this is too easy for you, try to do it
using only standard command-line tools from the Unix world.

### Downloading files from the PDB

    wget 'http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/download/downloadFile.do\? fileFormat=fasta&compression=NO&structureId=3KYH'
    wget http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/download/downloadFile.do\?fileFormat\=fasta\&structureId\=3KYH -O 3KYH.fasta
