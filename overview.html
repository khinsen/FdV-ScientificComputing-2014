# FdV course "Scientific Computing" 2014

### Konrad Hinsen

Centre de Biophysique Moléculaire, Orléans, France

Synchrotron SOLEIL, Saint Aubin, France

# Computer-Aided Research

 - Computers have invaded science: no scientist can work without a
   computer any more.

 - Computer technology moves at a very fast pace, much faster
   than scientific progress.

 - In the early days of computers, technology was developed by
   scientists and for scientists. Today, scientists use technology
   developed originally designed for business, engineering, or
   games.

 - The goal of this course is to show you basic techniques of
   using computers in science that have proven to work in many
   fields.

 - Another goal is to point out traps that you can easily fall into.

---

# Computers change more than technology

 - Science is a collective activity, implying a community.
   Communication is an important ingredient.

 - The Web makes exchanging and publishing data much easier.

 - Large-scale collaboration, even anonymous collaboration,
   becomes a possibility.

 - Pushed to the extreme, we get [Open
   Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science): doing
   research completely in public

 - Traditional journals are complemented by on-line journals,
   data archives, discussion forums, etc.

---

# Theory and practice

 - I will explain concepts and provide a theoretical background,
   and guide you through the first steps of using important tools.

 - You will need more practice to master these tools than the
   sessions of the course can provide.

 - **Try to use these tools as soon as possible for your own work.**

 - If you run into problems, we can discuss them here.

 - I will use the tools I advertise in preparing the course.
