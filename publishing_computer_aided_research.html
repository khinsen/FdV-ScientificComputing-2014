# Publishing is an important part of doing research

 - Publications constitute the scientific record of studies and their results

 - A publication must provide enough detail for replication of the study

# Publishing is important for a scientist's career

 - "Publish or perish"

 - Bibliometry as a substitute for evaluating quality

# Two distinct goals create conflicts of interest

 - Advancing science requires detailed and accurate publications
   of innovative studies.

 - Advancing a career in science requires a large number of
   publications that catch interest.

 - Peer review is supposed to ensure that scientists work for
   science and not just for their careers.

With the increase of publication output and specialization, peer review
works less and less well - but that's not today's topic.

---

# What do we publish (ideallly)?

Experimental studies:

 - the setup of the experiment, the experimental protocol
 - all the results of all observations
 - data analysis protocols
 - processed data
 - an interpretation

Theoretical studies:

 - the theoretical model(s)
 - assumptions and approximations
 - mathematical and computational procedures
 - the results of interest to the authors
 - an interpretation

No need to publish "all results" for theoretical work:

 - Anyone can do computations starting from the same models, assumptions,
   and approximations using the described procedures. There is no
   "experimental error", nor any "uncontrolled parameters".
 - An infinite number of results can be obtained from any given model.

---

# Computation and automation have changed the game

Experiments:

 - Automated recording of observations can create huge amounts of data,
   too much for publication in a paper.

 - Data analysis protocols take the form of computer programs.
   Often no other precise and complete formulation exists.

 - Papers no longer contain all observations, and only a summary
   of the data analysis protocols.
   
Theoretical work:

 - Models and computational procedures often exist only in the form
   of computer programs.

 - Papers provide only summaries of models, assumptions, approximations,
   and procedures, making it impossible for their readers to do their
   own computations.


Computing and automation have led to scientific papers becoming less
and less complete, because the publishing technique is no longer
adequate. This has led to serious mistakes in publications (see this
[Nature news story](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101013/full/467775a.html)),
and probably also to increased fraud.

**Computer-aided research requires publishing _all the software_
and _all observed data_ in electronic form.**

# Why publish software and data?

 - Moral obligation for any good citizen of the scientific community.

 - For your career: bibliometry starts taking software and data
   into account.

 - A [recent study](http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.175) claims that
   publishing the data will lead to more citations of your papers.

 - Journals are starting to require data publication with article
   submissions. Software publication will likely follow.

# Where?

 - Supplementary material for an article.

 - Data repositories: [figshare](http://figshare.com/),
   [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/), plus domain-specific
   or institution-specific sites

 - Version-control hosting sites: [GitHub](http://github.com),
   [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/), plus institution-specific
   sites such as [Sourcesup](http://sourcesup.renater.fr/) in France.

 - For large datasets, [Academic Torrents](http://www.academictorrents.com/)

# What?

 - At the very least, the files used in your work: software source
   code, data files, workflows.

 - Better: files that are easy to understand and use by others.
   This requires thinking about publication _before_ doing
   the research.

# In the ideal world...

... there would be a file format for storing, sharing, and publishing
_computations_, i.e. combinations of programs and datasets, with all
the dependency information of a workflow.

_Self-advertisement:_ this happens to be a [research
project](http://activepapers.org/) that I am working on.


## In the real world...

... we have to do the best we can with the tools we have. Let's look
at some of them.

# IPython notebook

A notebook is a mixture of program code, results, and documentation.
It is a good medium to explain computations and their results.

A notebook can also contain short datasets, e.g. from experiments,
expressed as Python data structures.

More information [on the IPython Web site](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

The IPython notebook was initially written for the Python language,
but support for other languages is being added. Working right now:
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [Julia](http://julialang.org/).

An IPython notebook is a plain text file that can be managed
with version control.

Similar approaches:

 - [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) for R
 - [Org-mode/Babel](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/index.html)
   for Emacs users
 - [Sage notebooks](http://www.sagenb.org/)
 - [Mathematica notebooks](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/NotebooksAsDocuments.html)

# Literate programming

Combination of text and program code, but no live computation nor
any results embedded in the document. Usually no maths either.

Notebooks are much better for "telling a story" about a computational
study, they are closer to a paper. Literate programming tools
provide one features that notebooks don't have: the possibility
to describe multi-file software libraries.

Some popular tools (there are many more):

 - [noweb](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/) is a popular
   literate programming tool

 - [pyWeb](http://pywebtool.sourceforge.net/) is a more modern
   alternative

 - [Leo](http://leoeditor.com/) is an editor for literate programs

---

# What's still missing?

 - Literate programs combine software with explanations.

 - Notebooks add results, and graphics.

 - The missing piece is _data_.

 - Small and simply structured datasets can be integrated
   into a notebook.

 - Big or structured datasets need special file formats
   and separate storage.

 - The best you can do right now is bundle up everything
   in a zip file.

---

# A look into the future

 - Scientific publishers are experimenting with new publication
   technologies, integrating multimedia content, interactive exploration
   of data, etc.

 - On-line executable computations as companion sites to articles
   are proposed by [Exec&Share](http://execandshare.org).
   Elsevier is testing a similar approach called
   [Collage](http://collage.elsevier.com/).

 - Scientific cloud hosting sites such as [Wakari](http://wakari.io)
   permit the publication of IPython notebooks together with
   support libraries and datasets, letting anyone explore
   your results.

 - [ActivePapers](http://www.activepapers.org/) permits the bundling
   of code and datasets into publishable bundles.

It is safe to assume that the publication of scientific computation
will be very different a few years from now.
