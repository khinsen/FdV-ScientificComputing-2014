# Computer-aided research in collaboration

 - The most important problems are not technical ones, but social
    ones.

 - No piece of software will solve the social issues.

 - What matters most is to agree on tools and procedures that
   everybody is comfortable with.

 - There's a tendency to ask the "computer expert" in the group to
   pick the right tools and help the others to use them.

 - If you are that "computer expert", keep in mind that your preferred
   tools and procedures may be too sophisticated for the others.

 - On the other hand, limiting the group to the methods that everybody
   already knows is often a bad choice as well.  You need some minimal
   standards, which must include version control.

# Branches in version control

Basic use of version control creates a linear chain of versions,
representing the progress of the work over time:

![Linear chain of versions](./images/git-when-revisions-updated.svg)

That's usually all you ever need for personal work. When working
in a team, _branches_ are inevitable:

![Branches](./images/git-intro-to-branching.svg)

# Branching and merging

Branches come into existence when different people work in
parallel. Moreover, a single researcher may wish to create multiple
branches for better organizing his/her work.

Most often, branches represent a temporary divergence of a shared lab
notebook, and the ultimate goal is to _merge_ these branches into a
single concensus version.

![Branches](./images/git-merged-branches.svg)

Merging cannot be a fully automatic step, because the two
branches to be merged can contain conflicting information.
In such a case, any version control system will stop and
ask the user to resolve the conflict.

In a research project, it is often useful to do merges
together, in a group meeting.

# Branching in Git

The extensive support for managing branching is often cited as
an advantage of Git over other version control systems. There are
numerous tutorials on handling branches in Git.

However, most of the Git branching functionality (and the tutorials)
is great for software development, but of much less interest for
doing research. In the electronic lab notebook, branches serve
mainly to permit everyone to work independently.

A Git repository can contain any number of _local_ branches,
each identified by a name. It can also reference any number
of branches in repositories stored elsewhere (e.g. on GitHub).
These are called _remote_ branches and are identified by
the name of the remote repository and the name of the branch
inside the remote repository.

# Merging in Git

In Git, merging is not a fully symmetric operation:

![Branches](./images/git-merge-b-into-a.svg)

<hr>

![Branches](./images/git-merge-a-into-b.svg)

The only difference is the name of the surviving branch.

# The shared electronic lab notebook

A lab notebook for a team of N scientists needs at least N+1 branches:

 - One branch for each scientist's personal work.

 - One branch containing a concensus version.

The concensus version should be managed by very few people. It is
updated by merging in changes from everybody. This is best done during
a group meeting.

![Workflot](./images/git-lab-notebook-workflow.svg)

# Repositories and branches

### The official repository

 - Contains only the concensus branch.
 - Readable by everyone in the group.
 - Write access limited to a few people.
 - For Open Science, hosted on a public site (GitHub, ...)

### Each scientist's personal repository

 - Has a local copy of the concensus branch.
 - Has the scientist's personal branch.
 - Is located on the scientist's personal computer.

### Each scientist's public repository

 - Contains a copy of the personal repository.
 - Readable by everyone, write access limited to its owner.
 - Serves as a backup.
 - Permits everyone to see everyone else's work.

---

# Research workflow

### Individual work

 - Each scientist works in his/her personal repository.
 - Changes are committed frequently.
 - Commits are pushed to the public repository as soon as possible.

### Group meeting

 - Changes from each scientist's public repository are merged
   into the concensus branch in the official repository.
 - Conflicts are resolved together.

### Right after the group meeting

 - Each scientist merges the concensus branch from the official repository
   into his/her personal branch in the personal repository.
 - Each scientist pushes changes from his/her personal repository
   to his/her public repository.
