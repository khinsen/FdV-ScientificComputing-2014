# Version Control with Git

# Introducing Version Control

Wolfman and Dracula have been hired by Universal Missions
(a space services spinoff from Euphoric State University)
to figure out where the company should send its next planetary lander.
They want to be able to work on the plans at the same time,
but they have run into problems doing this in the past.
If they take turns,
each one will spend a lot of time waiting for the other to finish,
but if they work on their own copies and email changes back and forth
things will be lost, overwritten, or duplicated.

The right solution is to use [version control](./gloss.html#version-control)
to manage their work.
Version control is better than mailing files back and forth because:

*   Nothing that is committed to version control is ever lost.
    This means it can be used like the "undo" feature in an editor,
    and since all old versions of files are saved
    it's always possible to go back in time to see exactly who wrote what on a particular day,
    or what version of a program was used to generate a particular set of results.
*   It keeps a record of who made what changes when,
    so that if people have questions later on,
    they know who to ask.
*   It's hard (but not impossible) to accidentally overlook or overwrite someone's changes,
    because the version control system highlights them automatically.

This lesson shows how to use
a popular open source version control system called Git.
It is more complex than some alternatives,
but it is widely used,
primarily because of a hosting site called [GitHub](http://github.com).
No matter which version control system you use,
the most important thing to learn is not the details of their more obscure commands,
but the workflow that they encourage.

---

# A Better Kind of Backup

The first time we use Git on a new machine,
we need to configure a few things (we'll insert blank lines
between groups of shell commands to make them easier to read):

~~~
$ git config --global user.name "Vlad Dracula"

$ git config --global user.email "vlad@tran.sylvan.ia"

$ git config --global color.ui "auto"

$ git config --global core.editor "nano"
~~~

(Please use your own name and email address instead of Dracula's,
and please make sure you choose an editor that's actually on your system
rather than `nano`.)

Git commands are written `git verb`,
where `verb` is what we actually want it to do.
In this case,
we're telling Git:

*   our name and email address,
*   to colorize output,
*   what our favorite text editor is, and
*   that we want to use these settings globally (i.e., for every project),

---

The four commands above only need to be run once:
Git will remember the settings until we change them.
Once Git is configured,
we can start using Git.
Let's create a directory for our work:

~~~
$ mkdir planets

$ cd planets
~~~

and tell Git to make it a [repository](./gloss.html#repository):

~~~
$ git init
~~~

If we use `ls` to show the directory's contents,
it appears that nothing has changed:

~~~
$ ls
~~~

But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory called `.git`:

~~~
$ ls -a
.	..	.git
~~~

Git stores information about the project in this special sub-directory.
If we ever delete it,
we will lose the project's history.

---

We can ask Git for the status of our project at any time like this:

~~~
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
~~~

We'll explain what `branch master` means later.
For the moment,
let's add some notes about Mars's suitability as a base.
(We'll `cat` the text in the file after we edit it so that you can see what we're doing,
but in real life this isn't necessary.)

~~~
$ nano mars.txt

$ cat mars.txt
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color

$ ls
mars.txt

$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	mars.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~~~

---

The "untracked files" message means that there's a file in the directory
that Git isn't keeping track of.
We can tell Git that it should do so like this:

~~~
$ git add mars.txt
~~~

and check that the right thing happened like this:

~~~
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#	new file:   mars.txt
#
~~~

Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of this file,
but it hasn't yet recorded any changes for posterity.
To get it to do that,
we need to run one more command:

~~~
$ git commit -m "Starting to think about Mars"
[master (root-commit) f22b25e] Starting to think about Mars
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 mars.txt
~~~

---

When we run `git commit`,
Git takes everything we have told it to save using `git add`
and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory.
This permanent copy is called a [revision](.././gloss.html#revision).
We use the `-m` flag (for "message")
to record a comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why.
If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option,
Git will launch `nano` (or whatever other editor we configured at the start)
so that we can write a longer message.

If we run `git status` now:

~~~
$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
~~~

it tells us everything is up to date.
If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can ask Git to show us the project's history:

~~~
$ git log
commit f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b
Author: Vlad Dracula <vlad@tran.sylvan.ia>
Date:   Thu Aug 22 09:51:46 2013 -0400

    Starting to think about Mars
~~~

Now suppose Dracula adds more information to the file:

~~~
$ nano mars.txt

$ cat mars.txt
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
~~~

---

We don't need to run `git add` again,
because Git already knows this file is on the list of things it's managing.
If we run `git status`,
it tells us the file has been modified:

~~~
$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   mars.txt
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~

The last line is the key phrase:
"no changes added to commit".
We have changed this file,
but we haven't committed to making those changes yet.

---

Let's double-check our work using `git diff`,
which shows us the differences between
the current state of the file
and the most recently saved version:

~~~
$ git diff
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..315bf3a 100644
--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
+The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
~~~

The output is cryptic because
it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and `patch`
telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other.
If we can break it down into pieces:

1.   The first line tells us that Git is using the Unix `diff` command
     to compare the old and new versions of the file.
2.   The second line tells exactly which [revisions](.././gloss.html#revision) of the file
     Git is comparing;
     `df0654a` and `315bf3a` are unique computer-generated labels for those revisions.
3.   The remaining lines show us the actual differences
     and the lines on which they occur.
     The numbers between the `@@` markers indicate which lines we're changing;
     the `+` on the lines below show that we are adding lines.

---

Let's commit our change:

~~~
$ git commit -m "Concerns about Mars's moons on my furry friend"
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   mars.txt
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~

Whoops:
Git won't commit because we didn't use `git add` first.
Let's do that:

~~~
$ git add mars.txt

$ git commit -m "Concerns about Mars's moons on my furry friend"
[master 34961b1] Concerns about Mars's moons on my furry friend
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
~~~

Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit
before actually committing anything
because we often won't commit everything at once.
For example,
suppose we're adding a few citations to our supervisor's work
to our thesis.
We might want to commit those additions,
and the corresponding addition to the bibliography,
but *not* commit the work we've been doing on the conclusion.

---

To allow for this,
Git has a special staging area
where it keeps track of things that have been added to
the current [change set](./gloss.html#change-set)
but not yet committed.
`git add` puts things in this area,
and `git commit` then copies them to long-term storage:

![The Git Staging Area](./images/git-staging-area.svg)

---

The following commands show this in action:

~~~
$ nano mars.txt

$ cat mars.txt

But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity

$ git diff

So far, so good:
we've made a change,
and `git diff` tells us what it is.
Now let's put that change in the staging area
and see what `git diff` reports:

~~~
$ git add mars.txt

$ git diff

There is no output:
as far as Git can tell,
there's no difference between what it's been asked to save permanently
and what's currently in the directory.

However,
if we do this:

~~~

Let's save our changes:

If we want to see what we changed when,
we use `git diff` again,
but refer to old versions
using the notation `HEAD~1`, `HEAD~2`, and so on:

~~~
$ git diff HEAD~1 mars.txt

`HEAD` means "the most recently saved version".
`HEAD~1` (pronounced "head minus one")
means "the previous revision".
We can also refer to revisions using
those long strings of digits and letters
that `git log` displays.
These are unique IDs for the changes,
and "unique" really does mean unique:
every change to any set of files on any machine
has a unique 40-character identifier.

---

Our first commit was given the ID
f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b,
so let's try this:

~~~
$ git diff f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b mars.txt

That's the right answer,
but typing random 40-character strings is annoying,
so Git lets us use just the first few:

~~~
$ git diff f22b25e mars.txt
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt

All right:
we can save changes to files and see what we've changed---how
can we restore older versions of things?
Let's suppose we accidentally overwrite our file:

~~~
$ nano mars.txt

$ cat mars.txt
We will need to manufacture our own oxygen
~~~

`git status` now tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been staged:

~~~
$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   mars.txt
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~

We can put things back the way they were like this:

~~~
$ git reset --hard HEAD
HEAD is now at 005937f Thoughts about the climate

$ cat mars.txt
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
~~~

---

The `--hard` argument to `git reset` tells it to throw away local changes:
without that,
`git reset` won't destroy our work.
`HEAD` tells `git reset` that we want to put things back to
the way they were recorded in the `HEAD` revision.
(Remember,
we haven't done a `git commit` with these changes yet,
so `HEAD` is still where it was.)
We can use `git reset --hard HEAD~55` and so on
to back up to earlier revisions,
`git reset --hard 34961b1` to back up to a particular revision,
and so on.

But what if we want to recover somes files without losing other work we've done since?
For example,
what if we have added some material to the conclusion of our paper that we'd like to keep,
but we want to get back an earlier version of the introduction?
In that case,
we want to check out an older revision of the file,
so we do something like this:

~~~
$ git checkout 123456 mars.txt
~~~

but use the first few digits of an actual revision number instead of 123456.
To get the right answer,
we must use the revision number that identifies the state of the repository
*before* the change we're trying to undo.
A common mistake is to use the revision number of
the commit in which we made the change we're trying to get rid of:

![When Git Updates Revision Numbers](./images/git-when-revisions-updated.svg)

The fact that files can be reverted one by one
tends to change the way people organize their work.
If everything is in one large document,
it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction
without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion.
If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files,
on the other hand,
moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.

---

# Collaborating

Version control really comes into its own
when we begin to collaborate with other people.
We already have most of the machinery we need to do this;
the only thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.

Systems like Git and Mercurial allow us to move work between any two repositories.
In practice,
though,
it's easiest to use one copy as a central hub,
and to keep it on the web rather than on someone's laptop.
Most programmers use hosting services like [GitHub](http://github.com) or [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org)
to hold those master copies;
we'll explore the pros and cons of this in the final section of this lesson.

Let's start by sharing the changes we've made to our current project with the world.

Log in to GitHub,
then create a new repository called `planets`
using their GUI.

---

background-image: url(./images/github-create-repo-01.png)

---

background-image: url(./images/github-create-repo-02.png)

---

background-image: url(./images/github-create-repo-03.png)

---

This effectively does the following on GitHub's servers:

~~~
$ mkdir planets

$ cd planets

$ git init
~~~

Our local repository still contains our earlier work on `mars.txt`,
but the remote repository on GitHub doesn't contain any files yet:

![Freshly-Made GitHub Repository](./images/git-freshly-made-github-repo.svg)

---

The next step is to connect the two repositories.
We do this by making the GitHub repository a [remote](./gloss.html#repository-remote)
for the local repository.
The home page of the repository on GitHub includes
the string we need to identify it:

![Where to Find Repository URL on GitHub](./images/github-find-repo-string.png)


For now,
we'll use the 'http' [protocol](./gloss.html#protocol)
(which is also used by web browsers)
since it requires the least setup.
Copy that URL from the browser,
go into the local `planets` repository,
and run this command:

~~~
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/vlad/planets
~~~

(using your GitHub ID instead of `vlad`).
We can check that the command has worked by running `git remote -v`:

~~~
$ git remote -v
origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (push)
origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (fetch)
~~~

---

There's nothing magic about the name `origin`,
but we'll see in a moment why it's a sensible choice.
Once this is set up,
this command will push the changes from our local repository
to the repository on GitHub:

~~~
$ git push origin master
Counting objects: 9, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Writing objects: 100% (9/9), 821 bytes, done.
Total 9 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * [new branch]      master -> master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.
~~~

Our local and remote repositories are now in this state:

![GitHub Repository After First Push](./images/github-repo-after-first-push.svg)

---

> ### The '-u' Flag
>
> You may see a `-u` option used with `git push`.
> This tells Git what [branch](.././gloss.html#branch) to use
> in the repository you're pushing to.
> We discuss branches and branching in our intermediate-level lessons.


We can pull changes from the remote repository to the local one as well:

~~~
$ git pull origin master
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.
~~~

Pulling has no effect in this case
because the two repositories are already synchronized.
If someone else had pushed some changes,
though,
this command would download them to our local repository.
We can simulate this by going to another directory&mdash;for example, `/tmp`&mdash;and
[cloning](./gloss.html#repository-clone) our GitHub repository:

~~~
$ cd /tmp
$ git clone https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
~~~

---

`git clone` creates a fresh local copy of a remote repository.
(We did it in `/tmp` or some other directory so that we don't overwrite our existing `planets` directory.)
Our computer now has two copies of the repository:

![After Creating Duplicate Clone of Repository](./images/git-after-duplicate-clone.svg)


Let's make a change in the copy in `/tmp/planets`:

~~~
$ cd /tmp/planets

$ nano pluto.txt

$ cat pluto.txt
It is so a planet!

$ git add pluto.txt

$ git commit -m "Some notes about Pluto"
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 pluto.txt
~~~

---

then push the change to GitHub:

~~~
$ git push origin master
Counting objects: 4, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 306 bytes, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
   9272da5..29aba7c  master -> master
~~~

Our three repositories now look like this:

![After Pushing Change from Duplicate Repository](./images/git-after-change-to-duplicate-repo.svg)

---

We can now download changes into the original repository on our machine:

~~~
$ cd ~/planets

$ git pull origin master
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Updating 9272da5..29aba7c
Fast-forward
 pluto.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 pluto.txt
~~~

In practice,
we would probably never have two copies of the same remote repository
on our laptop at once.
Instead,
one of those copies would be on our laptop,
and the other on a lab machine,
or on someone else's computer.
Pushing and pulling changes gives us a reliable way
to share work between different people and machines.

---

# Conflicts

As soon as people can work in parallel,
someone's going to step on someone else's toes.
This will even happen with a single person:
if we are working on a piece of software on both our laptop and a server in the lab,
we could make different changes to each copy.
Version control helps us manage these [conflicts](./gloss.html#conflict)
by giving us tools to [resolve](./gloss.html#resolve) overlapping changes.

To see how we can resolve conflicts,
we must first create one.
The file `mars.txt` currently looks like this
in both local copies of our `planets` repository
(the one in our home directory and the one in `/tmp`):

~~~
$ cat mars.txt
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
~~~

Let's add a line to the copy under our home directory:

~~~
$ nano mars.txt

$ cat mars.txt
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
This line added to our home copy
~~~

---

and then push the change to GitHub:

Our repositories are now in this state:

Now let's switch to the copy under `/tmp`
and make a different change there
*without* updating from GitHub:

~~~
$ cd /tmp/planets

$ nano mars.txt

$ cat mars.txt
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We added a different line in the temporary copy
~~~

We can commit the change locally:

~~~
$ git add mars.txt

$ git commit -m "Adding a line in the temporary copy"
[master 07ebc69] Adding a line in the temporary copy
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
~~~

but Git won't let us push it to GitHub:

~~~
$ git push origin master
To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/vlad/planets.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull')
hint: before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
~~~

---

Git detects that the changes made in one copy overlap with those made in the other
and stops us from trampling on our previous work.
What we have to do is pull the changes from GitHub,
[merge](./gloss.html#repository-merge) them into the copy we're currently working in,
and then push that.
Let's start by pulling:

~~~
$ git pull origin master
remote: Counting objects: 5, done.        
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.        
remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 3 (delta 1)        
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Auto-merging mars.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in mars.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
~~~

`git pull` tells us there's a conflict,
and marks that conflict in the affected file:

~~~
$ cat mars.txt
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
<<<<<<< HEAD
We added a different line in the temporary copy
=======
This line added to our home copy
>>>>>>> dabb4c8c450e8475aee9b14b4383acc99f42af1d
~~~

Our change---the one in `HEAD`---is preceded by `<<<<<<<`.
Git has then inserted `=======` as a separator between the conflicting changes
and marked the end of the content downloaded from GitHub with `>>>>>>>`.
(The string of letters and digits after that marker
identifies the revision we've just downloaded.)

---

It is now up to us to edit this file to remove these markers
and reconcile the changes.
We can do anything we want:
keep the change in this branch,
keep the change made in the other,
write something new to replace both,
or get rid of the change entirely.
Let's replace both so that the file looks like this:

~~~
$ cat mars.txt
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We removed the conflict on this line
~~~

To finish merging,
we add `mars.txt` to the changes being made by the merge
and then commit:

~~~
$ git add mars.txt

$ git status
# On branch master
# All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
#   (use "git commit" to conclude merge)
#
# Changes to be committed:
#
#	modified:   mars.txt
#

$ git commit -m "Merging changes from GitHub"
[master 2abf2b1] Merging changes from GitHub
~~~

---

Our repositories now look like this:

![After Making Second (Conflicting) Change](./images/git-after-second-conflicting-change.svg)


so we push our changes to GitHub:

~~~
$ git push origin master
Counting objects: 10, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 697 bytes, done.
Total 6 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
   dabb4c8..2abf2b1  master -> master
~~~

---

to get this:

![After Merging Changes Locally](./images/git-after-merging.svg)

Git keeps track of what we've merged with what,
so we don't have to fix things by hand again
if we switch back to the repository in our home directory and pull from GitHub:

~~~
$ cd ~/planets

$ git pull origin master
remote: Counting objects: 10, done.        
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.        
remote: Total 6 (delta 2), reused 6 (delta 2)        
Unpacking objects: 100% (6/6), done.

 mars.txt | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
~~~

---

we get the merged file:

~~~
$ cat mars.txt 
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We removed the conflict on this line
~~~

We don't need to merge again because GitHub knows someone has already done that.

Version control's ability to merge conflicting changes
is another reason users tend to divide their programs and papers into multiple files
instead of storing everything in one large file.
There's another benefit too:
whenever there are repeated conflicts in a particular file,
the version control system is essentially trying to tell its users
that they ought to clarify who's responsible for what,
or find a way to divide the work up differently.

# Open Science


<blockquote>
The opposite of "open" isn't "closed".
The opposite of "open" is "broken".
<br/>
&mdash; John Wilbanks
</blockquote>

Free sharing of information might be the ideal in science,
but the reality is often more complicated.
Normal practice today looks something like this:

*   A scientist collects some data and stores it on a machine
    that is occasionally backed up by her department.
*   She then writes or modifies a few small programs
    (which also reside on her machine)
    to analyze that data.
*   Once she has some results,
    she writes them up and submits her paper.
    She might include her data---a growing number of journals require this---but
    she probably doesn't include her code.
*   Time passes.
*   The journal sends her reviews written anonymously by a handful of other people in her field.
    She revises her paper to satisfy them,
    during which time she might also modify the scripts she wrote earlier,
    and resubmits.
*   More time passes.
*   The paper is eventually published.
    It might include a link to an online copy of her data,
    but the paper itself will be behind a paywall:
    only people who have personal or institutional access
    will be able to read it.

---

For a growing number of scientists,
though,
the process looks like this:

*   The data that the scientist collects is stored in an open access repository
    like [figshare](http://figshare.com/) or [Dryad](http://datadryad.org/)
    as soon as it's collected,
    and given its own DOI.
*   The scientist creates a new repository on GitHub to hold her work.
*   As she does her analysis,
    she pushes changes to her scripts
    (and possibly some output files)
    to that repository.
    She also uses the repository for her paper;
    that repository is then the hub for collaboration with her colleagues.
*   When she's happy with the state of her paper,
    she posts a version to [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/)
    or some other preprint server
    to invite feedback from peers.
*   Based on that feedback,
    she may post several revisions
    before finally submitting her paper to a journal.
*   The published paper includes links to her preprint
    and to her code and data repositories,
    which  makes it much easier for other scientists
    to use her work as starting point for their own research.

This open model accelerates discovery:
the more open work is,
the more widely it is cited and re-used.
However,
people who want to work this way need to make some decisions
about what exactly "open" means in practice.

---

### Licensing

The first question is licensing.
Broadly speaking,
there are two kinds of open license for software,
and half a dozen for data and publications.
For software,
people can choose between the [GNU Public License](http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0) (GPL) on the one hand,
and licenses like the [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
and [BSD](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) licenses on the other.
All of these licenses allow unrestricted sharing and modification of programs,
but the GPL is [infective](../gloss.html#infective-license):
anyone who distributes a modified version of the code
(or anything that includes GPL'd code)
must make *their* code freely available as well.

Proponents of the GPL argue that this requirement is needed
to ensure that people who are benefiting from freely-available code
are also contributing back to the community.
Opponents counter that many open source projects have had long and successful lives
without this condition,
and that the GPL makes it more difficult to combine code from different sources.
At the end of the day,
what matters most is that:

1.   every project have a file in its home directory
     called something like `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.txt`
     that clearly states what the license is, and
2.   people use existing licenses rather than writing new ones.

The second point is as important as the first:
most scientists are not lawyers,
so wording that may seem sensible to a layperson
may have unintended gaps or consequences.
The [Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/)
maintains a list of open source licenses,
and [tl;drLegal](http://www.tldrlegal.com/) explains many of them in plain English.

---

When it comes to data, publications, and the like,
scientists have many more options to choose from.
The good news is that an organization called [Creative Commons(http://creativecommons.org/)
has prepared a set of licenses using combinations of four basic restrictions:

*   Attribution: derived works must give the original author credit for their work.
*   No Derivatives: people may copy the work, but must pass it along unchanged.
*   Share Alike: derivative works must license their work under the same terms as the original.
*   Noncommercial: free use is allowed, but commercial use is not.

These four restrictions are abbreviated "BY", "ND", "SA", and "NC" respectively,
so "CC-BY-ND" means,
"People can re-use the work both for free and commercially,
but cannot make changes and must cite the original."
These [short descriptions](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/)
summarize the six CC licenses in plain language,
and include links to their full legal formulations.

There is one other important license that doesn't fit into this categorization.
Scientists (and other people) can choose to put material in the public domain,
which is often abbreviated "PD".
In this case,
anyone can do anything they want with it,
without needing to cite the original
or restrict further re-use.
The table below shows how the six Creative Commons licenses and PD relate to one another:

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td colspan="7" align="center">Licenses that can be used for derivative work or adaptation</td>

  </tr>

[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/license.html)
uses CC-BY for its lessons and the MIT License for its code
in order to encourage the widest possible re-use.
Again,
the most important thing is for the `LICENSE` file in the root directory of your project
to state clearly what your license is.
You may also want to include a file called `CITATION` or `CITATION.txt`
that describes how to reference your project;
the one for Software Carpentry states:

~~~
To reference Software Carpentry in publications, please cite both of the following:

Greg Wilson: "Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned". arXiv:1307.5448, July 2013.

@online{wilson-software-carpentry-2013,
  author      = {Greg Wilson},
  title       = {Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned},
  version     = {1},
  date        = {2013-07-20},
  eprinttype  = {arxiv},
  eprint      = {1307.5448}
}
~~~

### Hosting

The second big question for groups that want to open up their work
is where to host their code and data.
One option is for the lab, the department, or the university to provide a server,
manage accounts and backups,
and so on.
The main benefit of this is that it clarifies who owns what,
which is particularly important if any of the material is sensitive
(i.e.,
relates to experiments involving human subjects
or may be used in a patent application).
The main drawbacks are the cost of providing the service and its longevity:
a scientist who has spent ten years collecting data
would like to be sure that data will still be available ten years from now,
but that's well beyond the lifespan of most of the grants that fund academic infrastructure.

The alternative is to use a public hosting service like [GitHub](http://github.com),
[BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org),
[Google Code](http://code.google.com),
or [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net).
All of these allow people to create repositories through a web interface,
and also provide mailing lists,
ways to keep track of who's doing what,
and so on.
They all benefit from economies of scale and network effects:
it's easier to run one large service well
than to run many smaller services to the same standard,
and it's also easier for people to collaborate if they're using the same service,
not least because it gives them fewer passwords to remember.

However,
all of these services place some constraints on people's work.
In particular,
most give users a choice:
if they're willing to share their work with others,
it will be hosted for free,
but if they want privacy,
they may have to pay.
Sharing might seem like the only valid choice for science,
but many institutions may not allow researchers to do this,
either because they want to protect future patent applications
or simply because what's new is often also frightening.
